# igorOS

Jose Catarino's Monorepo for embedded projects and maker's lab automation

## Overview

The goal of igorOS is to be a collection of software tools to automate and orchestrate a maker's lab.

### Status

* **June,  2022:** Very early stage. Repo created on June 3rd.

## Tech Stack

### Infrastructure

The hope is that eventually the code will migrate to a serverless backend where it makes sense. For now, all "cloud" functionality is running on my local server, accessible via a Flask app REST API.
